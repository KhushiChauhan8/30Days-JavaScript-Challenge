# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## 💪 Today's Challenge

Today, I completed a series of tasks focused on implementing and understanding various data structures in JavaScript. These activities helped me enhance my knowledge and skills in linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and graphs. Here's a detailed breakdown of what I learned:

---

### 📋 Activity 1: Linked List

#### Task 1: Implement a Node Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - How to create a class in JavaScript.
  - The concept of a node with properties `value` and `next`.

#### Task 2: Implement a LinkedList Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Building a linked list with methods to add, remove, and display nodes.
  - Traversing a linked list to find the end and manipulate nodes.

### 📚 Activity 2: Stack

#### Task 3: Implement a Stack Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Fundamentals of stack data structure.
  - Methods to push, pop, and peek elements in a stack.

#### Task 4: Reverse a String Using Stack
- **What I Learned:**
  - Practical application of stacks to solve real-world problems.
  - Reversing a string by utilizing stack operations.

### 🎟️ Activity 3: Queue

#### Task 5: Implement a Queue Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Basics of queue data structure.
  - Methods to enqueue, dequeue, and view the front element.

#### Task 6: Simulate a Printer Queue
- **What I Learned:**
  - Simulating a real-world scenario using queues.
  - Managing and processing jobs in a sequence.

### 🌳 Activity 4: Binary Tree

#### Task 7: Implement a TreeNode Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Understanding binary tree nodes with `value`, `left`, and `right` properties.

#### Task 8: Implement a BinaryTree Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Inserting values into a binary tree.
  - Performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

### 🌐 Activity 5: Graph (Optional)

#### Task 9: Implement a Graph Class
- **What I Learned:**
  - Basics of graph data structures.
  - Adding vertices and edges to create connections.

#### Task 10: Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **What I Learned:**
  - Traversing a graph using BFS.
  - Finding the shortest path between nodes in a network.
