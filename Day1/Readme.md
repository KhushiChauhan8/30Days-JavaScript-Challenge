## Learning Outcomes

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
- **Task 1**: Learned to declare a variable using `var`, assign it a value, and log it to the console.
- **Task 2**: Learned to declare a variable using `let`, assign it a value, and log it to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
- **Task 3**: Learned to declare a variable using `const`, assign it a value, and log it to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
- **Task 4**: Created variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and used the `typeof` operator to identify and log each variable's type.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
- **Task 5**: Declared a variable using `let`, assigned it an initial value, reassigned a new value, and logged both values to the console to understand how reassignment works with `let`.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`
- **Task 6**: Attempted to reassign a variable declared with `const` to observe the resulting error, demonstrating the immutability of `const` variables.

### Feature Requests
- **Feature 1**: Declared variables of different data types and logged both the value and type of each variable to the console.
- **Feature 2**: Demonstrated the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.
