# Day 7: Objects

## Description
This script demonstrates the creation and manipulation of JavaScript objects through various tasks and activities. By completing these tasks, I learned how to create objects, access and update their properties, add methods, work with nested objects, and iterate over object properties.

## Tasks and Activities

### Activity 1: Object Creation and Access

**Task 1:** Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year, and log the object to the console.
- **Learned:** How to create a basic object with properties.

**Task 2:** Access and log the title and author properties of the book object.
- **Learned:** How to access object properties using dot notation.

### Activity 2: Object Methods

**Task 3:** Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's title and author, and log the result of calling this method.
- **Learned:** How to add methods to an object and use the `this` keyword to access object properties within a method.

**Task 4:** Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter (year) and updates the book's year property, then log the updated object.
- **Learned:** How to create methods that update object properties and pass parameters to methods.

### Activity 3: Nested Objects

**Task 5:** Create a nested object representing a library with properties like name and books (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console.
- **Learned:** How to create nested objects and arrays of objects.

**Task 6:** Access and log the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.
- **Learned:** How to access nested object properties and iterate over an array of objects.

### Activity 4: The `this` Keyword

**Task 7:** Add a method to the book object that uses the `this` keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log the result of calling this method.
- **Learned:** How to use the `this` keyword within an object's method to refer to the object's properties.

### Activity 5: Object Iteration

**Task 8:** Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value.
- **Learned:** How to iterate over an object's properties using a `for...in` loop.

**Task 9:** Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.
- **Learned:** How to use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` to get an array of an object's keys and values, respectively.

## Conclusion
By completing these tasks, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript objects, including how to create, access, and update properties, add methods, work with nested objects, and iterate over object properties. This knowledge is fundamental for working with more complex data structures in JavaScript and building dynamic applications.
