# 🚀 Day 18 Challenge: Regular Expressions in JavaScript

## 📚 Activities and Tasks

### 🎯 Activity 1: Basic Regular Expressions
1. **Task 1:** Write a regular expression to match a simple pattern (e.g., match all occurrences of the word "JavaScript" in a string). Log the matches.
2. **Task 2:** Write a regular expression to match all digits in a string. Log the matches.

### 🔤 Activity 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers
3. **Task 3:** Write a regular expression to match all words in a string that start with a capital letter. Log the matches.
4. **Task 4:** Write a regular expression to match all sequences of one or more digits in a string. Log the matches.

### 🔍 Activity 3: Grouping and Capturing
5. **Task 5:** Write a regular expression to capture the area code, central office code, and line number from a US phone number format (e.g., (123) 456-7890). Log the captures.
6. **Task 6:** Write a regular expression to capture the username and domain from an email address. Log the captures.

### 🔒 Activity 4: Assertions and Boundaries
7. **Task 7:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the beginning of a string. Log the matches.
8. **Task 8:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the end of a string. Log the matches.

### 🌐 Activity 5: Practical Applications
9. **Task 9:** Write a regular expression to validate a simple password (must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character). Log whether the password is valid.
10. **Task 10:** Write a regular expression to validate a URL. Log whether the URL is valid.

## 🏅 Feature Requests
1. **Basic Regex Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to match simple patterns and log the matches.
2. **Character Classes and Quantifiers Script:** Create a script that uses regular expressions to match words with specific characteristics and log the matches.
3. **Grouping and Capturing Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to capture parts of a string, such as phone numbers and email addresses, and log the captures.
4. **Assertions and Boundaries Script:** Create a script that uses regular expressions to match words at specific positions in a string and log the matches.
5. **Validation Script:** Write a script that uses regular expressions to validate passwords and URLs and log whether they are valid.

## 🎉 Conclusion

Today, I completed the 18th day of my 30-day challenge focusing on **Regular Expressions** in JavaScript! 🚀 Here's a summary of what I learned:

1. **Basic Regular Expressions:** 🌟 I learned how to match simple patterns and digits in a string using regular expressions.
2. **Character Classes and Quantifiers:** ✨ I discovered how to use character classes and quantifiers to match specific patterns, such as capitalized words and sequences of digits.
3. **Grouping and Capturing:** 🛠️ I practiced capturing specific parts of strings, like phone numbers and email addresses, using grouping and capturing techniques.
4. **Assertions and Boundaries:** 🔍 I explored how to use assertions and boundaries to match words at the beginning or end of strings.
5. **Practical Applications:** 🌐 I applied regular expressions to validate passwords and URLs, ensuring they meet specific criteria.

This challenge has significantly enhanced my understanding of regular expressions and their practical applications in JavaScript. I'm excited to continue this journey and tackle more complex challenges ahead! 💪🚀
