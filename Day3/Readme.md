# JavaScript Control Structures Tasks

This repository contains several JavaScript scripts that demonstrate the use of various control structures, including if-else statements, nested if-else statements, switch cases, the ternary operator, and combining multiple conditions. Each script is part of a learning exercise to deepen understanding of these concepts. 

## Activities and Tasks

### Activity 1: If-Else Statements

#### Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
- **Script:** `checkNumber(num)`
- **Description:** This function checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements and logs the result to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Gained understanding of basic if-else conditional logic.

#### Task 2: Check Voting Eligibility
- **Script:** `checkVotingEligibility(age)`
- **Description:** This function checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age (18 or older) and logs the result to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Learned how to use if-else statements to evaluate conditions based on numerical comparisons.

### Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements

#### Task 3: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
- **Script:** `findLargest(a, b, c)`
- **Description:** This function finds the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements and logs the result to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Gained understanding of how to nest if-else statements to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially.

### Activity 3: Switch Case

#### Task 4: Determine the Day of the Week
- **Script:** `getDayOfWeek(dayNum)`
- **Description:** This function uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and logs the day name to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Learned how to use switch cases to handle multiple conditions based on discrete values.

#### Task 5: Assign a Grade Based on a Score
- **Script:** `assignGrade(score)`
- **Description:** This function assigns a grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') based on a score using a switch case and logs the grade to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Understood how to use switch cases with ranges of values using comparison within cases.

### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

#### Task 6: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- **Script:** `checkEvenOdd(num)`
- **Description:** This function uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and logs the result to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Learned how to use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

### Activity 5: Combining Conditions

#### Task 7: Check if a Year is a Leap Year
- **Script:** `checkLeapYear(year)`
- **Description:** This function checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and logs the result to the console.
- **Learning Outcome:** Gained understanding of combining multiple conditions using logical operators.

## Feature Requests

#### Feature 1: Number Check Script
- **Script:** `featureNumberCheck(num)`
- **Description:** This script checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements and logs the result.

#### Feature 2: Voting Eligibility Script
- **Script:** `featureVotingEligibility(age)`
- **Description:** This script checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and logs the result.

#### Feature 3: Day of the Week Script
- **Script:** `featureDayOfWeek(dayNum)`
- **Description:** This script uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and logs the day name.

#### Feature 4: Grade Assignment Script
- **Script:** `featureAssignGrade(score)`
- **Description:** This script uses a switch case to assign a grade based on a score and logs the grade.

#### Feature 5: Leap Year Check Script
- **Script:** `featureCheckLeapYear(year)`
- **Description:** This script checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and logs the result.

## What I Learned

Through completing these tasks, I have learned:

- How to use if-else statements to make decisions in my code.
- How to nest if-else statements to evaluate complex conditions.
- How to use switch cases for handling multiple discrete conditions.
- How to use the ternary operator for concise conditional logic.
- How to combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
- How to apply these control structures to solve real-world problems.

These exercises have significantly enhanced my understanding of control structures in JavaScript, preparing me for more advanced programming concepts and tasks.
