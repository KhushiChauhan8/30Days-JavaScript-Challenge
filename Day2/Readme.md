# JavaScript Practice Tasks

This project includes various tasks that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. Below is a description of each task and what I learned by completing them.

## Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

### Task 1: Addition
- **Description**: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned how to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition in JavaScript and how to create and call functions.

### Task 2: Subtraction
- **Description**: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I understood how to perform subtraction operations and the importance of logging outputs for debugging.

### Task 3: Multiplication
- **Description**: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I practiced multiplication in JavaScript and reinforced my understanding of function creation.

### Task 4: Division
- **Description**: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned about division, including handling cases where division by zero might occur, and how to handle such cases gracefully.

### Task 5: Remainder
- **Description**: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I practiced using the modulus operator to find remainders and understood its applications.

## Activity 2: Assignment Operators

### Task 6: += Operator
- **Description**: Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned how to use the `+=` assignment operator to simplify addition operations on variables.

### Task 7: -= Operator
- **Description**: Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I understood the use of the `-=` assignment operator for simplifying subtraction operations.

## Activity 3: Comparison Operators

### Task 8: > and < Operators
- **Description**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned to compare values using the greater than and less than operators and understood their practical applications.

### Task 9: >= and <= Operators
- **Description**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I practiced using the greater than or equal to and less than or equal to operators to compare values effectively.

### Task 10: == and === Operators
- **Description**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I understood the difference between equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`) and their importance in JavaScript.

## Activity 4: Logical Operators

### Task 11: && Operator
- **Description**: Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned to use the logical AND (`&&`) operator to combine multiple conditions in my programs.

### Task 12: || Operator
- **Description**: Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I practiced using the logical OR (`||`) operator to combine conditions and understood its applications.

### Task 13: ! Operator
- **Description**: Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned to use the logical NOT (`!`) operator to negate conditions and understood its use cases.

## Activity 5: Ternary Operator

### Task 14: Ternary Operator
- **Description**: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
- **What I Learned**: I learned to use the ternary operator (`? :`) for conditional expressions, making my code more concise and readable.

## Feature Request Scripts

### Arithmetic Operations Script
- **Description**: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
- **What I Learned**: I consolidated my understanding of arithmetic operations by integrating them into a single script and handling various operations in a structured manner.

### Comparison and Logical Operators Script
- **Description**: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
- **What I Learned**: I deepened my understanding of comparison and logical operators by combining them in a single script, improving my ability to use various operators effectively.

### Ternary Operator Script
- **Description**: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
- **What I Learned**: I implemented the ternary operator in a practical scenario, enhancing my decision-making logic in scripts and making my code more efficient.

## Conclusion

By completing these tasks, I gained a solid understanding of basic arithmetic operations, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and the ternary operator in JavaScript. These fundamental concepts are essential for any JavaScript developer and form the foundation for more advanced programming topics.
