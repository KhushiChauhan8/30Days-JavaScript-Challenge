# Day 13: Modules üì¶

## Tasks/Activities üìö

### Activity 1: Creating and Exporting Modules ‚ú®

**Task 1:**
Create a module that exports a function to add two numbers. Import and use this module in another script.

**Task 2:**
Create a module that exports an object representing a person with properties and methods. Import and use this module in another script.

### Activity 2: Named and Default Exports üåü

**Task 3:**
Create a module that exports multiple functions using named exports. Import and use these functions in another script.

**Task 4:**
Create a module that exports a single function using default export. Import and use this function in another script.

### Activity 3: Importing Entire Modules üì¶

**Task 5:**
Create a module that exports multiple constants and functions. Import the entire module as an object in another script and use its properties.

### Activity 4: Using Third-Party Modules üåê

**Task 6:**
Install a third-party module (e.g., lodash) using npm. Import and use a function from this module in a script.

**Task 7:**
Install a third-party module (e.g., axios) using npm. Import and use this module to make a network request in a script.

### Activity 5: Module Bundling (Optional) üõ†Ô∏è

**Task 8:**
Use a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single file. Write a script to demonstrate the bundling process.

## Feature Requests üéØ

1. **Basic Module Script:** Write a script that creates a module exporting a function and imports it in another script.
2. **Named and Default Exports Script:** Create a script demonstrating both named and default exports and their usage.
3. **Third-Party Module Script:** Write a script that installs, imports, and uses functions from third-party modules like lodash and axios.
4. **Module Bundling Script:** Create a script demonstrating how to bundle JavaScript files using a module bundler (optional).

## Achievements üèÜ

By the end of these activities, I was able to:

- Create and export functions, objects, and constants using modules.
- Import modules using named and default imports.
- Use third-party modules installed via npm.
- Understand the basics of module bundling (optional).

### Completed Challenges ‚úÖ

- **Task 1:** Created a module to add two numbers and imported it.
- **Task 2:** Created a module representing a person and imported it.
- **Task 3:** Created a module with multiple functions using named exports and imported them.
- **Task 4:** Created a module with a single function using default export and imported it.
- **Task 5:** Created a module with multiple constants and functions and imported the entire module.
- **Task 6:** Used Lodash via CDN and implemented a function from it.
- **Task 7:** Used Axios via CDN to make a network request.
- **Task 8:** Configured Webpack to bundle JavaScript files (optional).

### Summary ‚úçÔ∏è

These tasks helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript modules, both built-in and third-party. I also gained experience in setting up and using module bundlers like Webpack, which is essential for modern JavaScript development.
