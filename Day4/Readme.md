# Day 4: Loops in JavaScript

## Tasks and Activities

### Activity 1: For Loop

#### Task 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 10
**Description**: I learned how to use a `for` loop to print numbers sequentially from 1 to 10.

#### Task 2: Print Multiplication Table of 5
**Description**: I practiced using a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of 5, reinforcing how loops can simplify repetitive tasks.

### Activity 2: While Loop

#### Task 3: Calculate Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10
**Description**: I utilized a `while` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, understanding how to maintain a running total within a loop.

#### Task 4: Print Numbers from 10 to 1
**Description**: I implemented a `while` loop to print numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1, demonstrating the flexibility of loop conditions.

### Activity 3: Do...While Loop

#### Task 5: Print Numbers from 1 to 5
**Description**: I used a `do...while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, learning how this loop guarantees at least one execution of the loop body.

#### Task 6: Calculate Factorial of a Number
**Description**: I applied a `do...while` loop to calculate the factorial of a given number, practicing iterative multiplication.

### Activity 4: Nested Loops

#### Task 7: Print a Pattern Using Nested For Loops
**Description**: I explored nested `for` loops to print a pattern of stars, enhancing my understanding of multi-level iteration.

### Activity 5: Loop Control Statements

#### Task 8: Skip Number 5 Using Continue
**Description**: I learned to use the `continue` statement to skip specific iterations within a loop, in this case, skipping the number 5.

#### Task 9: Stop Loop at Number 7 Using Break
**Description**: I practiced using the `break` statement to exit a loop prematurely when encountering the number 7.

## Feature Requests

### 1. Number Printing Script
**Description**: Created a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using both a `for` loop and a `while` loop, demonstrating different loop structures.

### 2. Multiplication Table Script
**Description**: Developed a script to print the multiplication table of 5 using a `for` loop, showing how loops can be used for repetitive calculations.

### 3. Pattern Printing Script
**Description**: Wrote a script to print a pattern of stars using nested loops, illustrating the concept of nested iteration.

### 4. Sum Calculation Script
**Description**: Built a script to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop, emphasizing loop control and accumulation.

### 5. Factorial Calculation Script
**Description**: Created a script to calculate the factorial of a number using a `do...while` loop, applying loop iteration to factorial computation.

## What I Learned

### For Loop
- Learned to use `for` loops for iterating over a range of numbers and performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

### While Loop
- Understood the flexibility of `while` loops for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

### Do...While Loop
- Explored the unique behavior of `do...while` loops that ensure the loop body is executed at least once.

### Nested Loops
- Gained experience in using nested loops for complex iteration patterns and multi-level looping.

### Loop Control Statements
- Learned to control loop execution with `continue` and `break` statements, enabling selective iteration and early termination of loops.

These tasks and activities deepened my understanding of JavaScript loops, providing practical skills for handling repetitive tasks and complex iterations in programming.
