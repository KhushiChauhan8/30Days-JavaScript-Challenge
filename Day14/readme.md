# JavaScript Classes Examples 🎓

## Overview 📝

In this project, I explored various aspects of JavaScript classes through a series of tasks and activities. Each activity focused on a different feature of classes, such as class definition, inheritance, static methods and properties, getters and setters, and private fields.

### Activity 1: Class Definition 📚

#### Tasks:
1. **Class Definition with Properties and Methods**: Defined a `Person` class with properties for the first name, last name, and age. Implemented a method to return a greeting message. 👋
2. **Updating Properties**: Added a method to the `Person` class to update the age property and log the updated age. 🔄

### Activity 2: Class Inheritance 🏫

#### Tasks:
3. **Class Inheritance**: Created a `Student` class that extends the `Person` class, adding a student ID property and a method to return the student ID. 🆔
4. **Method Overriding**: Overrode the greeting method in the `Student` class to include the student ID in the message. 💬

### Activity 3: Static Methods and Properties ⚙️

#### Tasks:
5. **Static Methods**: Added a static method to the `Person` class that returns a generic greeting message. Called this method without creating an instance of the class. 🌐
6. **Static Properties**: Added a static property to the `Student` class to keep track of the number of students created, incremented this property in the constructor, and logged the total number of students. 📊

### Activity 4: Getters and Setters 🛠️

#### Tasks:
7. **Getters**: Added a getter method to the `Person` class to return the full name. 🧑‍💻
8. **Setters**: Added a setter method to the `Person` class to update the name properties. Updated the name using the setter and logged the updated full name. ✍️

### Activity 5: Private Fields (Optional) 🔒

#### Tasks:
9. **Private Fields**: Defined an `Account` class with private fields for balance and methods to deposit and withdraw money. Ensured that the balance can only be updated through these methods. 💰
10. **Testing Private Methods**: Created an instance of the `Account` class and tested the deposit and withdraw methods, logging the balance after each operation. 🏦

## Achievements 🏆

By completing these activities, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

- **Defining and using classes** with properties and methods. 🏗️
- **Implementing inheritance** to extend classes and override methods. 🌟
- **Utilizing static methods and properties** in classes. ⚡
- **Applying getters and setters** for better encapsulation. 🔐
- **Understanding and using private fields** in classes to protect data (optional). 🚫

These concepts are fundamental for object-oriented programming in JavaScript and have equipped me with the skills to create more structured and maintainable code. 🚀

## Summary 🎉

This project provided hands-on experience with JavaScript classes, reinforcing the principles of object-oriented programming. By working through each task, I have solidified my understanding of class definitions, inheritance, static methods and properties, getters and setters, and private fields. These skills are crucial for developing robust and scalable JavaScript applications. 💪
