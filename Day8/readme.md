# JavaScript ES6+ Features

## Overview

In this document, we outline the JavaScript ES6+ features explored through various tasks. Each task demonstrates different ES6+ features including template literals, destructuring, spread and rest operators, default parameters, and enhanced object literals. Completing these tasks has provided a solid understanding of these features and their practical applications.

## Tasks and Descriptions

### Activity 1: Template Literals

- **Task 1:** Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.
  - **Description:** This task demonstrates how to use template literals for string interpolation.
  - **Learning:** Gained understanding of embedding variables in strings using `${}` syntax.

- **Task 2:** Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.
  - **Description:** This task shows how to create strings that span multiple lines using template literals.
  - **Learning:** Learned how to preserve formatting across multiple lines.

### Activity 2: Destructuring

- **Task 3:** Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console.
  - **Description:** This task demonstrates array destructuring to extract specific elements.
  - **Learning:** Acquired knowledge on extracting values from arrays using destructuring.

- **Task 4:** Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.
  - **Description:** This task shows object destructuring to extract properties from an object.
  - **Learning:** Gained skills in extracting values from objects using destructuring.

### Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators

- **Task 5:** Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, and log the new array to the console.
  - **Description:** This task illustrates how to use the spread operator to merge arrays.
  - **Learning:** Learned to combine arrays and add new elements using the spread operator.

- **Task 6:** Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.
  - **Description:** This task demonstrates the rest operator in function arguments.
  - **Learning:** Understood how to handle a variable number of function arguments and perform operations on them.

### Activity 4: Default Parameters

- **Task 7:** Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.
  - **Description:** This task shows the use of default parameters in functions.
  - **Learning:** Gained insights into setting default values for function parameters and handling optional arguments.

### Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals

- **Task 8:** Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, and log the object to the console.
  - **Description:** This task demonstrates creating objects with methods and shorthand properties.
  - **Learning:** Acquired knowledge in using enhanced object literals for more concise object definitions.

- **Task 9:** Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.
  - **Description:** This task shows how to use computed property names in objects.
  - **Learning:** Learned to dynamically set property names in objects using variables.

## What I Have Learned

Completing these tasks has significantly enhanced my understanding of modern JavaScript features. I have learned how to:
- Use template literals for easier string manipulation.
- Apply destructuring to simplify variable extraction from arrays and objects.
- Utilize spread and rest operators for flexible array and function management.
- Implement default parameters to handle optional function arguments effectively.
- Use enhanced object literals to streamline object creation and property definition.

These features collectively contribute to writing cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient JavaScript code.
