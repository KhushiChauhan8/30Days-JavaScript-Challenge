# Day 6: Arrays

## Overview

This file documents the tasks and activities completed as part of Day 6, focusing on arrays in JavaScript. The tasks were divided into various activities, covering array creation, access, basic and intermediate methods, iteration, and multi-dimensional arrays.

## Activities and Tasks

### Activity 1: Array Creation and Access
1. **Task 1:** Created an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and logged the array to the console.
2. **Task 2:** Accessed the first and last elements of the array and logged them to the console.

### Activity 2: Array Methods (Basic)
3. **Task 3:** Used the `push` method to add a new number to the end of the array and logged the updated array.
4. **Task 4:** Used the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array and logged the updated array.
5. **Task 5:** Used the `shift` method to remove the first element from the array and logged the updated array.
6. **Task 6:** Used the `unshift` method to add a new number to the beginning of the array and logged the updated array.

### Activity 3: Array Methods (Intermediate)
7. **Task 7:** Used the `map` method to create a new array where each number is doubled and logged the new array.
8. **Task 8:** Used the `filter` method to create a new array with only even numbers and logged the new array.
9. **Task 9:** Used the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and logged the result.

### Activity 4: Array Iteration
10. **Task 10:** Used a `for` loop to iterate over the array and logged each element to the console.
11. **Task 11:** Used the `forEach` method to iterate over the array and logged each element to the console.

### Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Arrays
12. **Task 12:** Created a two-dimensional array (matrix) and logged the entire array to the console.
13. **Task 13:** Accessed and logged a specific element from the two-dimensional array.

## Feature Requests

### 1. Array Manipulation Script
- Demonstrated the creation of an array and the use of `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` methods to manipulate the array.

### 2. Array Transformation Script
- Created a script that uses `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods to transform and aggregate array data.

### 3. Array Iteration Script
- Wrote a script that iterates over an array using both `for` loop and `forEach` method and logs each element.

### 4. Two-dimensional Array Script
- Created a script that demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a two-dimensional array.

## Learnings

By completing these tasks and activities, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of:
- Creating and accessing elements in arrays.
- Utilizing basic array methods such as `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.
- Applying intermediate array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to transform and aggregate data.
- Iterating over arrays using `for` loops and `forEach` method.
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays, including creation and specific element access.

This knowledge is fundamental for handling arrays efficiently in JavaScript, which is a crucial skill for any JavaScript developer.

## Conclusion

These exercises have provided practical experience with array operations, enhancing my ability to manipulate and iterate over arrays effectively in JavaScript.
