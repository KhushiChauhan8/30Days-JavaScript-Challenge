# Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage 🚀

## Tasks/Activities 📋

### Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage 📦

- **Task 1:** Save a string value to `localStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
- **Task 2:** Save an object to `localStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 2: Using LocalStorage 🗂️

- **Task 3:** Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `localStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
- **Task 4:** Write a script to remove an item from `localStorage`. Log the `localStorage` content before and after removal.

### Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage 📦

- **Task 5:** Save a string value to `sessionStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
- **Task 6:** Save an object to `sessionStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

### Activity 4: Using SessionStorage 🗂️

- **Task 7:** Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `sessionStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
- **Task 8:** Write a script to remove an item from `sessionStorage`. Log the `sessionStorage` content before and after removal.

### Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage ⚖️

- **Task 9:** Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
- **Task 10:** Write a function that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Verify that both storages are empty.

## Conclusion 🎉

Today, I delved deep into the fascinating world of web storage mechanisms, namely `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Here’s a summary of what I learned:

1. **localStorage and sessionStorage Basics:**
   - Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow for storing data as key-value pairs in the browser.
